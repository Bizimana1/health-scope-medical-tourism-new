                  India is one of the most popular destinations for medical
                  tourism in the world. Every year, millions of people from
                  different countries choose India for their medical needs,
                  ranging from simple check-ups to complex surgeries. There are
                  many reasons why India is the best choice for medical tourism,
                  such as:

                    <p className='text-justify text-slate-800'>
                      India offers high-quality medical care and treatment at a
                      fraction of the cost compared to other countries. You can
                      save up to 80% of the cost that you would incur in the US
                      for the same treatment. For instance A heart bypass
                      surgery costs $144,000 in the US, $25,000 in Costa Rica,
                      but only $5,200 in India and liver transplant costs around
                      $40,000, compared to $300,000 in the US.

                      Many of the doctors and surgeons working in India that
                      offer healthcare services to international patients are
                      highly trained and qualified with certification from
                      western countries like the US, UK, Germany. Also, several
                      medical centres all over India are accredited by
                      well-known global organisations like ISO, JCAHO, and JCI,
                      which shows that the medical facilities offered are of
                      international standards. So, patients coming to India for
                      availing treatment can be sure that they get quality
                      treatment and medical care.

                      India has a simple and quick medical visa application
